In conclusion, the concept of followership is based on a confusion of leadership and management. We need to get rid of followership to better engage employees, to show them more respect by conveying the impression that they are partners, not "followers" - a concept which suggests subservience, hence the need to invent an equally odd expression: the "courageous" follower. So what? This debate is important because we need employees to be better engaged. We can applaud the efforts of the followership camp to highlight the importance of employees with regard to organizational prosperity but we need to see their use of the term "follower" as self-defeating because it demeans what we are trying to empower. We need to see how employees can be leaders, not just followers. They can lead, not just their own teams, but anyone in the organization, up and sideways who they can influence to think or act differently. Isn't this much more empowering than calling employees "followers"?
